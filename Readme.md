### Presidents Talk
The indoctrination is so deep that educated people think theyâ€™re being objective.*
- Noam Chomsky

# Overview
This is a visual summary of twitter vocabulary of the personal accounts of two US presidents (Donald Trump and Barack Obama). The goal is to compare the language of choice of each person and observe where these differences and similarities reflect their political affiliation, economic trends, as well as the American culture. 

For each individual, the analysis will aim to answer questions suchs as: What are his most frequently used words? Which words does he like to go all-caps on? How does his choice of word(s) change over time? Do any of the trends in his vocabulary coincide with his life events (e.g., lawsuits, political activity, economic indeces)?
